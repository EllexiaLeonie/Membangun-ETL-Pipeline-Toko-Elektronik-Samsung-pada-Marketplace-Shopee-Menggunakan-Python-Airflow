## Membangun-ETL-Pipeline-Toko-Elektronik-Samsung-pada-Marketplace-Shopee-Menggunakan-Python-Airflow
##### In this project, we have conducted web scraping for Samsung mobile phone data on the Shopee platform using the Python environment. Then, we constructed a pipeline using Apache Airflow within a Docker environment to automate the workflow of ETL processes. And established connections to a PostgreSQL database to enable the automatic execution of the ETL system.
